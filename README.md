# Online-Library-Management-System
The Library Management System is a web application built using Flask, MySQL, and HTML/CSS to manage books and library members efficiently. It allows users to add, view, and issue books through an easy-to-use interface. The system streamlines library operations by maintaining organized records of books and transactions in a centralized database.
